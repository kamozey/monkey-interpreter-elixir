# Monkey Compiler in Elixir

**A Compiler for the Monkey language written in Elixir**

This is my translation of the book written by Thorsten Ball, Writing an interpreter in Go, but in Elixir instead of Go lang.

I've always wanted to write a compiler/interpreter. And now I have started writing one.

Update 10/06/2023 - I stopped writing this in Elixir, instead I completed it in C++. Refer my repo monkey-interpreter-cpp[https://github.com/rahultumpala/monkey-interpreter-cpp]
